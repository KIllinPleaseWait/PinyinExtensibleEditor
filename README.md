PinyinExtensibleEditor
======================

The PinyinExtensibleEditor or PEE allows users to input pinyin on a normal keyboard.

### Usage

Simply type pinyin with the tone number in the top text area and the pinyin will show 
up in the bottom text area. For example, pin1yin1 would turn into pīnyīn. If you want
to type a u with an umlaut and a tone mark then you can add 5 to the tone number. So 
yu8 would turn into yǘ.
